# Market Segmentation and Migration Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to create an interactive interface that allows users to find the best marketing segments by county and vice versa, based on specific parameters. It utilizes census data to classify people into groups based on job types and analyze migration trends. The goal is to create a valuable tool for businesses and policymakers to understand market dynamics and migration patterns.

## Objectives
- Develop an interface to identify optimal market segments by county and find the best areas to market based on user-defined parameters.
- Classify the population into groups based on job types (e.g., blue-collar, middle class).
- Analyze migration trends and how they impact different market segments.
- Create an interactive website to present findings and allow user interaction.

## Data Sources
- **U.S. Census Bureau**: Primary source for demographic, economic, and housing data.
- **American Community Survey (ACS)**: Detailed demographic, social, economic, and housing statistics.
- **Internal Revenue Service (IRS)**: Migration data based on tax returns.
- **State and Local Government Databases**: Additional region-specific data.

## Methodology
### Data Collection and Preprocessing
1. Collect relevant data from identified sources.
2. Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values and normalize formats.
3. Feature selection for segmentation and migration analysis.

### Market Segmentation
1. **Feature Selection**: Choose key features such as age, income, education, occupation.
2. **Clustering Techniques**: Explore and apply suitable clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, Hierarchical Clustering) to classify job types.
3. **Profile Creation**: Develop detailed profiles for each segment, including demographic characteristics and job types.

### Migration Analysis
1. Analyze migration inflows and outflows, reasons for migration, and demographic characteristics of movers.
2. Use data visualization techniques to show migration trends over time and identify key patterns.

### Integration of Segmentation and Migration Trends
1. Analyze how migration affects market segments and vice versa.
2. Assess how migration trends impact market opportunities in different counties or regions.

### Interactive Interface Development
1. **Backend**: Develop the backend using Python (e.g., Flask, Django) for data processing and analysis.
2. **Frontend**: Create an interactive frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (e.g., React, Vue.js) for user interaction and visualization.
3. **Visualization**: Use libraries like D3.js, Plotly, or Tableau for dynamic and interactive visualizations.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For data processing, analysis, and backend development.
- **Clustering Algorithms**: K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN.
- **Data Visualization**: D3.js, Plotly, Tableau.
- **Web Development**: Flask/Django (backend), React/Vue.js (frontend).
- **Geospatial Analysis**: GIS tools (ArcGIS, QGIS).

## Deliverables
- An interactive website hosted locally for user interaction.
- Detailed report summarizing findings, insights, and recommendations.
- Visualizations (maps, graphs, charts) to illustrate market segments and migration trends.
- Documentation for setup and usage of the interactive interface.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo/market-segmentation-project.git`
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the backend server: `python app.py`
4. Open `index.html` in your browser to access the interactive interface.
